### Installation

```bash
npm install --global @alchmy/youtube2ipfs
```

### Usage

#### Basic

By default, it is currently assumed that you have an IPFS daemon listening on localhost:5001, which is the default configuration of an IPFS daemon. If you wish to send to another endpoint, see the Advanced section.

```bash
youtube2ipfs 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wLCmDtCDAM'
```

Make sure that you put the main parameter in quotes so the shell does not try to expand any of the special characters.

#### Advanced


##### Sending to non-default endpoints.
This is for sending the video to a daemon not on localhost:5001. Just specify the flags --ip, --port, and --protocol.

```bash
youtube2ipfs 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wLCmDtCDAM' --ip '164.13.543.32' --port '3454' --protocol 'http'
```

##### To come

* Add an option to make persistant endpoint configuration. 
* When no node is detected, offer to install an IPFS daemon for the user and configure appropriately if needed.
